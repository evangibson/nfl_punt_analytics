If so, you're in luck. The [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/evangibson/nfl_punt_analytics/blob/master/making-simple-gifs-of-each-play-lower-memory.ipynb) in the present repository details the process I used to generate that gif. 

Please feel free to use this process when making gifs using similar data. Cheers!
